A machine learning-based tool for detecting malicious URLs. This project analyzes URLs based on various characteristics and predicts whether they are benign or malicious using a Random Forest Classifier.

📌 Features

Extracts features from URLs (length, special characters, etc.).

Uses Random Forest Classifier for classification.

Handles imbalanced datasets with imbalanced-learn.

Provides classification reports and URL predictions.
